My Experience of Learning a Traditional Skill

Last year, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to delve into the world of paper-cutting, a time - honored traditional Chinese art form. Initially, I encountered significant challenges in mastering the use of the scissors and precisely cutting out intricate patterns. The paper seemed to have a mind of its own, frequently tearing, and the lines I produced were far from smooth.Yet, I was determined not to let these setbacks discourage me. I embarked on a journey of self - study, watching countless online tutorials and dedicating time each day to practice. Little by little, my efforts began to bear fruit. I started to gain the ability to craft simple yet charming designs, such as those of animals and flowers.This experience of learning paper-cutting has been a transformative one. It has not only honed my patience and fine - tuned my hand - eye coordination but has also deepened my appreciation for the richness and allure of our traditional culture. It stands out as an immensely rewarding endeavor in my life.The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Our Lives

A Trip I Will Never Forget

Last summer, I went to Guilin with my parents. The moment I saw the Li River, I was deeply attracted by its clear water and the magnificent karst mountains on both sides. We took a bamboo raft along the river, enjoying the gentle breeze and the beautiful scenery.

We also visited the Reed Flute Cave, where the amazing rock formations were like a magical world. This trip not only broadened my horizons but also strengthened the bond between my family. It was truly an unforgettable experience.

Online learning has become popular, especially during the pandemic. It has many advantages. We can learn at any time and place, and there are various learning resources available online. For example, we can watch video lectures from famous professors.

However, it also has some disadvantages. It's hard to interact with teachers and classmates face - to - face, and it's easy to get distracted at home. In my opinion, online learning is a good supplement to traditional learning. We should make good use of it while also cherishing the opportunities for in - person learning.My Views on Online Learning
